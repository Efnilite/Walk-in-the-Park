# -------- Add your schematics here --------
# Add your schematic random number code or custom name here, followed by the difficulty.
# If your file is named parkour-658391, then you can either rename the file to parkour-22 ('22: 0.6') or
# just add '658391: 0.6'. Any questions? Join the Discord.

# -------- The difficulty of schematics --------
# These are represented by a number below or equal to 1.
# 1 = the most difficult
# 0.5 = medium
# 0 = super easy

# Difficulties are also represented by an easy word, which is nice for users.
# Players who pick i.e. "hard" will get every schematic below difficulty 0.7, so sometimes they will get easy (0.3).
# 0.8 to 1.0 = very hard
# 0.4 to 0.6 = hard
# 0.2 to 0.4 = medium
# 0.0 to 0.2 = easy
