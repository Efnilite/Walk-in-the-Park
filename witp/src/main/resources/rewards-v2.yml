# ----------- Rewards v2 -----------
# Each command needs a separate line, as you can see below.
# You can copy the format below and change the score/commands to add a reward.
# Reward commands are executed by the console.
# Scores of 0 do not work.
#
# Custom reward syntaxes:
# %player% - the player's name
# leave:test - executes a command on leave
# send:<bold>test - sends a message
# vault:-87 - deposits a specific amount of money (Vault required)
